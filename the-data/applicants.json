My proposal of using a workﬂow engine pattern similar to Netﬂix Conductor to solve our business problem had been accepted by the stakeholders & I technically led the team in building & delivering the App. I mentored and trained my young team in software best practices & clean code that resulted in a reliable & robust app. I helped my team to build the open tracing solution to trace the web calls across all the micro-services in our hybrid(on-prem/aws) infrastructure.

So all the loan products should adhere to the common loan model that we developed during the MRIA project. My proposal of remodeling our APIs to act as SaaS so that other teams in division would easily make their data available in the data lake was highly appreciated by my manager & other teams.

Helm : - • Application Deployment: Helm simplifies deploying complex applications by packaging all required resources into a single chart. This makes application deployment more consistent and repeatable. • Templating: Helm uses templates to generate Kubernetes manifests. Templates allow parameterization and customiza tion, making it simpler to manage configuration variations for different environments. • Versioning and Rollbacks: Helm keeps track of releases, enabling you to upgrade, rollback, or revert to specific versions of applications easily. • Reusability: Helm chart s can be shared, reused, and extended, improving collaboration and efficiency in Kubernetes -based projects. • Configuration Management: With Helm's values and templates, you can manage configuration files separately from the chart, enhancing configurability and maintainability. • Centralized Management: Helm charts centralize configurations, making it easier to manage applications and services across different Kubernetes clusters. • Infrastructure as Code: Helm charts can be versioned, stored in repositories, and treated as code, which aligns well with the DevOps practice of treating infrastructure as code.
